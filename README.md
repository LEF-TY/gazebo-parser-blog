# Parsing Gazebo for FEAGI
#### Lukas Finn, Timothy Marshall, Brenden Vaccaro, Benson Beck
During this semester, our team has worked on enabling FEAGI's artificial general intelligence to control a large variety of robotic simulations that originate from Gazebo, a platform designed for simulating the control of robots and their environments.	
# Using FEAGI With Gazebo
Our team was focused on creating a parsing program that converts Gazebo SDF files into readable JSON output to be used by the FEAGI Configurator, which will then generate necessary data for the Gazebo Controller. This project has allowed for robotic simulations of all types to successfully be controlled by FEAGI's artificial general intelligence.
